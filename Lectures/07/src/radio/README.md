# `radio` Example

This demonstrates the creating & configuration of `QRadioButton` widgets.

Compare this with the `checkbox` example.

Note how the radio buttons are mutually exclusive, as you'd expect.
Qt is able to enforce this behaviour because the three buttons have all
been added to the same container.
