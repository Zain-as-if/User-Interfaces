# Lecture 8 Source Code

Examples are organised into distinct subdirectories. Where necessary,
READMEs in those subdirectories provide further details of the examples
and how to compile them.

Use the following commands, within an example subdirectory, to build an
example (unless directed otherwise by a README for that example):

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

On systems where CMake has generated a makefile, you can replace the
last of the above commands with `make`.

The executable generated by this process will have the same name as the
example subdirectory.

## Examples

`control`
: Example of a composite widget, combining a slider with a numeric display
of the value on that slider.

`control2`
: Modification of the `control` example, demonstrating how we can respond
  to signals via a custom slot.

`editor`
: Example of subclassing `QMainWindow`.

`postcode`
: Example of creating a custom widget as a subclass of a standard
Qt widget -- in this case, a text entry widget that checks whether input
is a legal UK postcode.
